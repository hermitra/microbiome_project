# Microbiome Project - NUT 235 - Harvard Chan

Using publicly available data, and getting inspiration from the MDL4Microbiome Paper, I am making my own version of a multi modal neural network framework to classify healthy and disease states.

In order to run this code, you need to clone this repository onto your machine.

You also need to have an environment where Python and Jupyter Notebook are properly installed. 

Regarding the packages requires, you can run the following command:

```
!python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can just open the ```run_me.ipynb``` file and run cell by cell the notebook.
